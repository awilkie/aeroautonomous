Small quadrotor drone robot (Minidrot) platform (~2-25KG) that contains essential components to enable autonomous flight prototyping.

## Goals
1. Design, build, test (then fix) a drone that will can be enhanced with additional sensor and safety components later on.
2. Learn drone construction and fabrication skills
3. Upload code developed during 2018 [Flying Car course](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-content/PDFs/FlyingCar-WhatYoullLearn.pdf).
## Design Sketch
1. TODO
